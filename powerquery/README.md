# Powerquery repository
This repo is intended to provide a centralized storage of interesting powerqueries.
Powerqueries can be used to query for data in SentinelOnes Singularity XDR data lake or in Dataset.

Within the repo the queries are divided into different categories.

## EDR data based on network data 
- edr_network.pq
  - 

## EDR data based on natively ingested Windows Event Logs 
- edr_user.pq
  - A member was added to a security-enabled local group
  - potential bruteforce
